# Bey-Intentional
This is the Beyonce project, growing every now and then. The overall project takes in the lyrics, analyzes them, the prints out the interpretation of them

## IDEAS FOR FEATURES
1. Allow users to add their own interpretations of the song onto a bulletin board
2. Beyonce song mood suggester? Looks at aspects of the song from the csv file and reviews, GenAI could be useful in this part
3. Snippet of the song for the user to listen to
4. Display the Album Cover of the song

## PATHWAY
### Step 1: Data Preparation
Acquire Lyrics: You'll need to fetch the lyrics for each track. You can use APIs like Genius API, which requires you to register for an API key. You'll use the track_name and artist_name from your dataset to query the API and retrieve lyrics.  
Data Cleaning: Clean the lyrics data by removing non-lyrical content (e.g., [Chorus] or [Verse] annotations), special characters, and any HTML tags if the lyrics are scraped from the web.
### Step 2: Sentiment Analysis
Choose a Tool: Select a sentiment analysis tool. For Python, libraries like NLTK with VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) or TextBlob are popular for their simplicity and effectiveness in handling social media text types.  
Analyze Sentiment: Apply the sentiment analysis tool on the lyrics to derive sentiment scores. You can typically obtain measures like polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (objective to subjective content).
### Step 3: Data Analysis
Merge Data: Combine the sentiment data with your original dataset, ensuring each trackâ€™s sentiment is matched with its corresponding musical features.  
Statistical Analysis: Use statistical methods or data visualization (using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly) to explore relationships between lyrical sentiment and various musical features (e.g., valence, energy). Investigate correlations or create scatter plots to visualize these relationships.
### Step 4: Advanced Analysis (Optional)
Cluster Analysis: Perform clustering (e.g., K-means) to find patterns or groups of songs with similar sentiment and musical features.  
Time Series Analysis: If you're interested in how sentiment and music features have changed over time, consider grouping data by album or release year and analyze trends.
### Step 5: Visualization and Reporting
Create Visualizations: Develop insightful charts and graphs to illustrate the findings of your analysis. This could include heatmaps of correlation, time series plots of trends, or scatter plots with regression lines.  
Prepare a Report: Summarize your methodology, findings, and insights in a report. Include visualizations and discuss possible reasons for any trends or anomalies you discovered.
### Step 6: Presentation
Present Your Findings: Depending on your audience, prepare a presentation to share your project. Use tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides to showcase your process, visualizations, and conclusions.
